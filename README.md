Beware that self-bots are technically not allowed and you might get in trouble for using one.

How to get your user token:

1. open discord client
2. ctrl + shift + i
3. Application -> local storage -> discordapp.com
4. Refresh (F5)
5. token string should now show up at the bottom of the local storage, copy it into `token.txt`
