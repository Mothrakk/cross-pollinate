# cross-pollinate

Self-bot script to seek out people you share mutual servers with.

Beware that self-bots are technically not allowed and you might get in trouble for using one.

## Usage

Put your user token into `token.txt` and run `main.py`. The output will get exported to a new `mutuals.json` file.

**How to get your user token:**

1. open discord client
2. ctrl + shift + i
3. Application -> local storage -> discordapp.com
4. Refresh (F5)
5. token string should now show up at the bottom of the local storage, copy it into `token.txt`
